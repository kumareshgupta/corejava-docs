1. Encapsulation & Inheritance based
-------------------------------------- 
Note : Book and EngineeringBook classes will be in manipal.library package. BookDetails class will be in manipal.library.driver package.

a)	Create a class Book which has following members:
	private int bookNo
private String title
private String author
private float price

	Provide getter and setter methods for all the instance variables.
Create a class BookDetails which has the main method. Create an object of the Book class.  Initialize the object by reading inputs for the fields from the user and display all the details of book.

b)	Extend the Book class to create a class EngineeringBook derived from Book with an additional attribute
		private String category 	
Provide setter and getter methods for type instance variable.
Create an object of the EngineeringBook class in BookDetails’s main method  and test.

2. Inheritance and Abstraction based
-------------------------------------
Create abstract class PrepaidCard as per the below details
•	Has attributes CardNo(int), availableBalance(double), swipeLimit(double)
•	Abstract method swipeCard which takes amount as input and returns a boolean. 
•	Override toString to get object details in a formatted way
•	Concrete method rechargeCard which takes amount as input and adds it to availableBalance 

Create TravelCard as per below details
•	subclass of PrepaidCard
